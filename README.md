The file shows a screenshot of a Tableau Viz (Dashboard) I made using Citi Bike Data from https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html (in particular the data from 201706)

The Tablea Viz itself is available to view online at https://public.tableau.com/views/CitiBikeDashboard_16422475229650/Dashboard?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
